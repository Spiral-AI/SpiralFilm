# SpiralFilm 🌀🎥
## Introduction 🚀
SpiralFilm is your friendly neighborhood wrapper for the OpenAI ChatGPT family of APIs. It's designed for those knowledge-hungry language model enthusiasts who can't wait to whip up various applications at lightning speed. 🌩️

Here's how we roll:

- Unlike LlamaIndex 🦙, we're not into the whole integration-with-VectorDB-and-the-likes thing. We believe in you, developers, and trust in your abilities to call upon various databases as you please. 💪
- Forget about high-level abstraction like you'd see in LangChain 🔗. With us, you can tweak prompts without needing to dig into the dark depths of the code. 😎
- We're not into overcomplicating stuff. So, unlike guidance, we won't boggle you down with complex processing of prompts. We're more of a keep-it-simple-stupid kind of wrapper, especially when it comes to APIs like gpt-3.5-turbo 🚀 or gpt-4. 🤖

What we do bring to the table includes:

- Automatic retry (because sometimes, at first, you don't succeed) ↩️
- Placeholder functionality (like mad-libs, but for code) 🖍️
- Token count verification (keeping count, so you don't have to) 🔢
- Keeping you in the loop with confirmations of sent prompts, timing features, and logging 🕒
- Caching functionality (to speed up repeated requests and reduce server load) 🚀
- Async execution support, allowing you to run multiple tasks simultaneously, thereby making your application more efficient and responsive. 👾
- And more! 🎉

## Tutorial 📚

Now that you've got SpiralFilm installed, let's see it in action! Here are a couple of simple examples to get you started:

### Example 1: The Simple Scenario 🏄‍♀️
For this, we'll use the script in `examples/simple_example.py`

```python
from spiral_film import FilmCore

# First things first, let's set up the environment variable for your OpenAI API key
# Uncomment and insert your key as shown below
# import os
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your key here"

# Now, let's create a filmcore instance
f = FilmCore(
    prompt="""
Talk as you want.
You're {{user_name}}.
"""
).run(placeholders={"user_name": "Tom"})  # Let's pretend we're Tom for this one

# Print it out and see what Tom has to say!
print(f)
```

### Example 2: The Configured Convo 🤖
Next up, we'll use a configuration to fine-tune our instance. You can find this script in `examples/config_example.py`

```python
from spiral_film import FilmCore, FilmConfig

# Let's set up our config
config = FilmConfig(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.5, max_tokens=100)

# And our conversation template
_template = """
Talk as you want.
You're {{user_name}}.
"""

# Now we'll create a filmcore instance with our config and template
f = FilmCore(
    prompt=_template,
    config=config,
).run(placeholders={"user_name": "Tom"})  # Tom is back for another round!

# Let's see what Tom has to say under this new configuration
print(f)
```

### Example 3: Recollections and Context Memory 🧠
There's immense power in context, and with `FilmCore`, you can harness this power seamlessly. This example, which you can find in `examples/conversation_example.py`, showcases how you can retain context and query it in subsequent interactions:


By using the create_from method, we can ensure a smooth continuation of the conversation. So, whether it's a fact, a story detail, or a crucial piece of data, FilmCore helps keep the narrative threads intact. 🧵📖
```python
from spiralfilm import FilmCore

fc1 = FilmCore(
    prompt="""
Remember that x={{num}}.
Hello!
"""
)
print(fc1.run(placeholders={"num": "1234"}))

fc2 = FilmCore.create_from(
    fc1,
    prompt="""
Do you remember x?
                         """,
)

print(fc2.run())

```


### Example 4: Deep Dive with Embeddings 🌊
If you're keen on exploring semantic relationships between sentences, the `FilmEmbed` utility is your new best friend. Dive into the embedding space and uncover hidden dimensions of meaning. Let's see it in action in the `examples/embed_example.py` script:
```python
from spiralfilm import FilmEmbed

examples = []

examples.append("Today is a super good day.")
examples.append("Today is a good day.")
examples.append("Today is a bad day.")

vecs = FilmEmbed().run(texts=examples)


def calc_similarity(v1, v2):
    return sum([v1[i] * v2[i] for i in range(len(v1))])


print(
    f"Similarity between '{examples[0]}' and '{examples[1]}' : ",
    calc_similarity(vecs[0], vecs[1]),
)
print(
    f"Similarity between '{examples[0]}' and '{examples[2]}' : ",
    calc_similarity(vecs[0], vecs[2]),
)

```

With this, you're equipped to explore semantic spaces and better understand the relationship between different sentences. What story do your embeddings tell? 🧐📊

And that's it, folks! You're now ready to start making your own epic conversational masterpieces with SpiralFilm! 🎬🍿 Happy coding! 💻🚀
