# Welcome to SpiralFilm! ðŸŽ¬ðŸŽ‰
## Buckle up, here's what we're all about!
SpiralFilm is your super-duper, easy-peasy wrapper for the OpenAI GPT family of APIs! It's got all the bells and whistles to help users with a dab of language model know-how to whip up a vast variety of applications in a jiffy!

Here are the core philosophies we stand by:

- We don't try to fit all things into one, unlike LlamaIndex. No built-in integration with VectorDB or similar stuff here! We trust that our developers have the chops to call up whatever databases they need.
- Unlike LangChain, we're not into excessive abstraction. We love our developers to tweak prompts with ease, without going down the rabbit hole of code.
- No over-the-top processing of prompts like guidance, either. With conversational wizards like gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4 in mind, we stick to the basics and keep things lean and mean!

So what do you get in this awesome package?

- Auto-retry: For those "Oops!" moments.
- Placeholder functionality: Just like Mad Libs!
- Token count verification: No more hide and seek with tokens.
- Prompt confirmation, time measurement, and logging: For those "I wonder what happened" moments.
- Generating exceptions: Because sometimes, things go wrong, and that's okay!

Plus, as a cherry on top, we also pitch in some easy-to-manage version control templates for prompt modules. Talk about going the extra mile!
