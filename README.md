# SpiralFilm
SpiralFilm is a thin wrapper for the OpenAI GPT family of APIs. It packages the necessary features for users with a certain level of understanding of language models to create various applications as quickly as possible. The main design philosophies are:

Unlike LlamaIndex, it does not encompass integration with VectorDB and the likes. We expect developers to have a certain level of development capability to call various databases.
It does not provide a high level of abstraction like LangChain. Developers are able to easily modify prompts without delving deep into the code.
It does not perform overly complex processing of prompts like guidance. With conversational APIs like gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4 in mind, it keeps processing to the bare minimum.
As a result, the provided features include:

Automatic retry
Placeholder functionality
Token count verification
Confirmation of sent prompts, time measurement features, and logging
Generation of appropriate exceptions
Additionally, we propose templates for prompt modules that are easy to version control as an advanced feature.
